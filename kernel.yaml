  name: Tune
  type: Open-source developer tooling + desktop app + studio service
  founders: Ivan, Ilya
  nature: "Text-first agentic middleware + out-of-the-box desktop app + Brand OS studio"

constitution:
  mission: >
    To replace "AI vibes" with "Engineering discipline."
    We build the middleware (Tune) that makes agentic systems inspectable,
    testable, and composable via a simple text interface.

  north_star: >
    "Text is the Interface."
    Complex systems should be controlled by simple, versionable text files,
    not opaque drag-and-drop UIs or black-box prompts.

  core_thesis: |
    The best way to build a robust AI engine (Tune) is to continuously build
    production systems for real clients (Studio).
    Service funds Product. Product accelerates Service.

strategy:
  the_flywheel:
    1_build: "Solve a hard, specific problem for a client (Studio)."
    2_extract: "Refactor the solution into generic tools/middlewares (Tune Core)."
    3_enable: "Release the tools so others can build (Community/Product)."
    4_compound: "Next client build starts at a higher baseline."

  how_we_win:
    - Show, Don't Pitch: We are bad at sales decks. We are elite at "live demos on your data."
    - Build to Decide: We don't argue over specs. We prototype the system to force the decision.
    - Safety First: We sell reliability (evals, guardrails, citations), not just magic.
    - Text-Centric: We filter for clients/users who value transparency and control over "flashy UI."

operating_principles:
  - "Text is Truth": If it isn't in a file/config, it doesn't exist. No hidden magic.
  - "Middleware Mindset": Break big problems into small, chainable, testable steps.
  - "Determinism over Vibes": Always implement guardrails, citations, and evals. Never ship raw LLM output.
  - "Artifacts > Advice": Never deliver a PDF strategy. Deliver a runnable repository.
  - "Eat Your Own Dogfood": We run our company on Tune. Clients run on Tune.

offer_structure:
  opensource_tune:
    type: "Open Source / SDK + CLI"
    target: "Developers/Technical founders building agentic systems."
    promise: "A text-first, inspectable, testable agentic middleware—SDK, base tools, and editor extensions."
    components:
      - "SDK"
      - "Base tools"
      - "Extensions: VS Code, Neovim (and others)"
    pricing: "Free / OSS"
    goal: "Adoption + ecosystem + feedback loop into the core."

  desktop_app:
    type: "Desktop App"
    target: "Users who want Tune out-of-the-box (no setup / no plumbing)."
    promise: "Install and use Tune immediately with sensible defaults; optional power-user escape hatch into text configs."
    pricing: "TBD (free tier + paid?)"
    goal: "Distribution beyond devs + faster onboarding + monetization surface."

  studio_builds:
    type: "Service / Project"
    target: "Teams needing a specific production AI system (Support, Knowledge, Sales, Brand)."
    promise: "We build the system + the evaluation harness on top of Tune."
    pricing: "Fixed Sprint or Capped Pilot."
    goal: "Revenue + stress-testing Tune."

constraints:
  - No "Black Box" Builds: Client must own the system/repo eventually.
  - No "Consulting Only": We do not sell hours of talk. We sell hours of build.
  - No "GUI First": We solve the logic in text/code first. UI is just a wrapper.
  - No Unbounded Scope: Every engagement has a definition of "Done" based on testable outputs.

  audience_established:

    headline: "Tune Studio delivers an outcome traditional agencies can't."
    narrative: |
      If you're lucky, your agency delivers a beautiful vision.
      A sharp strategy. A few chief-supervised hero assets.
      Then reality hits.
      52 social posts. 4 landing pages. 120 ad variations. Sales decks. Onboarding emails.
      The person who built the strategy doesn't build the assets.
      The person who builds the assets didn't build the strategy.
      That gap is where brands become mediocre.

      Tune Studio installs a production engine.
      A Brand OS that runs your strategy. Your vision.
      Positioning, tone, and creative direction are encoded into the system.
      It generates ads, decks, landings, and campaigns — directly from the vision.

      The result: lossless translation from vision to every touchpoint.
      Scale kills quality.
      Our engine protects and compounds it.
      Every output carries the full weight of the original idea.

  audience_startups:
    label: "Founders / Early-stage startups"
    headline: "Does your strategy actually work when it hits reality?"
    narrative: |
      You're exploring a new idea.
      You hire a strategist to help structure the vision.
      They deliver positioning, messaging, maybe a manifesto.
      It reads well. It resonates on paper.

      Then you try to build with it.
      Landing page doesn't feel right.
      Pitch deck sounds different from the website.
      Ads simplify the message beyond recognition.
      Designer goes one direction. Copywriter goes another.

      Now you're stuck.
      Is the strategy wrong?
      Or did execution just miss?
      You can't tell. Nobody can.

      Tune Studio removes that ambiguity.
      We take your strategy and give it bones and meat — immediately.
      Positioning becomes real pages, real ads, real decks.
      Not as a "creative interpretation."
      As a direct, lossless translation.

      If it doesn't hold — you see it fast and fix the strategy.
      If it holds — you have a production engine that keeps shipping from that source.

      No gap between what you meant and what got built.
      No months lost wondering if the vision was right.

      Strategy stops being a document you hope survives.
      It becomes a system you test, prove, and scale.
